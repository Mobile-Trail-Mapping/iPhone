/**
 * A custom implementation of an ordered mutable dictionary. Provides access
 * to stored objects with both dictionary-style objectForKey: and array-style
 * objectAtIndex: methods.
 *
 * The default Cocoa collections interface provides only NSMutableDictionary
 * and NSMutableArray classes; there is no option for users who require an
 * "ordered dictionary," which stores its elements in a given order. Instead,
 * the default dictionary implementation in Cocoa uses a hash table, which is
 * inherently unordered.
 *
 * This class bridges that gap by internally using both an NSMutableDictionary
 * and NSMutableArray to store the data in the standard unordered way, but
 * allow access to that data with ordered key lookups.
 *
 * This "wrapping" incurs a reasonable performance hit. Generally,
 * dictionary-based methods perform in the same running time as their 
 * Cocoa counterparts; however, array-based methods (including objectAtIndex:)
 * will generally increase running time by a small amount, due to the need
 * to hit both the backing array and dictionary for a single lookup.
